    When I started this file, I started copy-pasting relevant things that I would think would be used to create the programs iteration. 

    Looking at the files more, I found that there were sections that were in different files that were nearly identical, and one of the files see med to have all of the required code. 
    To put it briefly, I couldn't even understand which piece of code was actually being called. Part of that is that I don't really understand the lifecycle and file rules to code for Wordpress. 

    So, what I am writing instead is how the next iteration should be done (if another person takes over for me).

    The programs block will essentially have the the same functionality; we will fetch the information for events and parse it to be shown in a list/grid view.
